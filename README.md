## Problem Statement

In India, there exists a critical disparity between the number of doctors available and the growing healthcare needs of the population. With a doctor-to-patient ratio of 1:1457, significantly below the WHO recommended ratio of 1:1000, our healthcare system faces immense challenges in delivering timely and accurate diagnoses. It affects people from both urban and rural areas.
## Goal

To address this pressing issue, our team has developed the website base service "SymtoCare" aimed at supporting medical professionals. At SymtoCare, our mission is to revolutionize healthcare by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to deliver accurate and timely disease identification, empowering both doctors and patients to make informed decisions and improve outcomes. We are committed to advancing medical diagnostics through innovation, compassion, and ethical practice, ensuring every individual receives the highest standard of care while safeguarding their privacy and dignity.
